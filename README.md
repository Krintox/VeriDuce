## 🔭 Project Overview

VeriDuce is a cutting-edge blockchain- and machine learning-powered marketplace designed to revolutionize carbon credit trading. The platform addresses critical inefficiencies, fraud, and lack of transparency in existing carbon credit markets.

By leveraging the power of Machine Learning for verification and prediction alongside Blockchain for transparency and security, VeriDuce creates a trustworthy, efficient, and impactful carbon credit trading ecosystem that:

- ✅ Ensures the authenticity of carbon emission reduction claims
- 🔒 Facilitates transparent and secure transactions
- 🌱 Promotes global sustainability initiatives
- 🛡️ Prevents double-spending and fraud through immutable ledger technology
- 🌐 Democratizes access to carbon credit markets for companies and individuals

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- **Transparency** 📊: Utilize blockchain to create an immutable ledger for all carbon credit transactions, ensuring trust and preventing double-spending.
- **Verification** 🔍: Employ advanced ML models to validate carbon credit claims based on environmental data, ensuring credits represent actual carbon emission reductions.
- **Accessibility** 🖥️: Provide a user-friendly web platform enabling companies, governments, and individuals to participate in carbon credit markets.
- **Scalability** ⚡: Implement an architecture that integrates with IoT devices and environmental sensors for global scalability.

## 🧩 Core Components

### 🤖 Machine Learning (ML)

Our platform incorporates three specialized ML models:

1. **Carbon Emission Predictor** 📉 ([Repository](https://github.com/Krintox/Veriduce_carbon_emmission_predictor))
   - Predicts potential carbon emissions reductions based on user-submitted data
   - Utilizes regression algorithms including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and LSTM networks
   - Processes features such as renewable energy usage, industrial output, and fuel type

2. **Carbon Credit Validator** ✅ ([Repository](https://github.com/Krintox/Veriduce_carbon_credit_validator))
   - Verifies the authenticity of carbon credit claims
   - Analyzes geospatial data and environmental sensor inputs
   - Employs CNNs for satellite imagery analysis and anomaly detection

3. **Fraud Detector** 🕵️ ([Repository](https://github.com/Krintox/Veriduce_fraud_detector))
   - Identifies suspicious patterns in carbon credit claims and transactions
   - Flags potential double-counting or inflated emission reduction claims
   - Uses anomaly detection algorithms to maintain market integrity

**ML Implementation:**
- 📊 Data collection from public datasets (EPA, IPCC), IoT devices, and environmental sensors
- 🧠 Model development using Python (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- 🗺️ Geospatial data processing with specialized libraries (Google Earth Engine, rasterio)
- 📈 Visualization capabilities using Matplotlib and Seaborn

### ⛓️ Blockchain

Our blockchain implementation provides:

- **Immutable Ledger** 📝: Records all transactions and ownership transfers on public blockchains
- **Smart Contracts** 📄: Automates issuance, transfer, and redemption of carbon credits
- **Tokenization** 🪙: Converts verified carbon credits into NFTs or ERC-20 tokens
- **Decentralized Storage** 💾: Stores large verification files using IPFS

**Blockchain Implementation:**
- 🔷 Built on Ethereum for smart contract capabilities and energy efficiency
- 📜 Smart contract development in Solidity
- 🛠️ Development frameworks including Hardhat
- 🔌 Integration libraries Web3.js and Ethers.js
- 👛 User wallet connections via MetaMask

### 🖥️ Web Development

The VeriDuce web portal ([Repository](https://github.com/Krintox/VeriDuce)) serves as the user interface for the entire ecosystem:

- **Frontend** 🎨: Responsive React.js interface with intuitive dashboards and visualizations
- **Backend** ⚙️: Flask for API endpoints connecting ML models and portal
- **Authentication** 🔐: Web3 authentication for secure wallet-based login
- **Analytics** 📊: Interactive data visualizations showing market trends and environmental impact

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The VeriDuce platform combines these components into a unified system:

```
